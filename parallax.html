      <p>Welcome! Welcome! I hope you are enjoying your stay here at the wonderful website of
        The Legend Himself. During this section, you will get to learn the true definition of utter insanity because I
        am about to go on a tangent of just random nonsense. Let us begin!</p>
      <p>It has been said that when the skies starts to rain cats and dogs that it is known to be raining really heavily
        outside, but who said that it was water that it is falling from the sky. It is literally raining cats and dogs
        outside and oh my dear GOD, it is not a pleasant sight. As the Great One once said, "The cornflakes are soggy",
        meaning... wait a minute... what in god's green earth does that even mean. You probably wondering why in my mind
        am I even reading this but that's not the point so I'll just give you some back story to this catastrophic
        event.</p>
      <p>This devastating phenomenon all starting back in 2005 when I was just a mere 5 year old. As a child I had no
        superpowers, if that's even relevant but whatever, and I thought it was cool to throw rocks in a random
        directions. I know, I was weird as a kid don't blame me ):<. Coincidentally, one of my rocks hit a dog that was
        approximately 50.123 degrees above the ground and 10 degrees to my right which then ricocheted 80.748 degrees to
        the left and hit a cat as well. Of course both the cat and dog were pissed beyond belief and you probably
        thought that I would get chased by them, but you are damn WRONG sir/ma'am! It turns out they were deities and
        forever cursed me and the human race by raining cats and dogs. Great you sure got me there dog/cat god.</p>
      <p>Well the moral of the story? Ummm....Don't throw rocks? The End!</p>
